My name is Alex Sewell, and I am twenty-two years old. Over the last two years, I have worked as a co-founder and head of research and operations for a startup out of Orange County called MotorMood. We are currently in the process of negotiating an exit for the company, and, because of this, it has allowed me to follow my dream of learning how to code.

The reason I am learning to code is because of the opportunities it creates.  Once learned, it allows you to create something out of nothing.  Any idea can be turned into reality.

The project I am presenting today is called Pizzalution, and I chose to work on this idea because of the difficulty I kept having when trying to compare comparing prices and order pizza.

Pizzalution is a single destination for people ordering pizza to find the best price.

This is my style sheet for my website.  I chose to have a three-color color scheme. The main color of the site is red.  Following in the footsteps of many restaurants such as Mcdonalds and In-and-Out, I chose red because it is an appetite stimulator and eye cathing color. Red also matches the typical sauce used on pizza.  The two other colors are supportive roles to the red.  The dark blue/almost black color is used to make the red color pop more.  And the white is used for high contrast so that the text is easy to read.

I chose the Genome font for my website because it is simplistic and modern.  I believe that the main age demographic for my website would be between 18-30.  I believe this font is relatable to other, more tech websites that they regularly frequent.

My goal for the layout of my website was to make it as easy to use as possible to accomplish the task it was built to perform.  I designed everything on one page to allow for simple step-by-step navigation and for quick load time for the website.

My code is laid out into three seperate pages.  The main index.html page, the default.css page, and the pizzalution.js page.

I attempted to name my class and other attributes to be easily read and understandable for anyone who is viewing the code.
